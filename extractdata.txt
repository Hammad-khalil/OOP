Key Points:
Abstract Base Class BasicShape:

It has a private variable area to store the area of shapes.
It has a method getArea to return the value of area.
It has an abstract method calcArea.
Class Circle (Derived from BasicShape):

It has private variables centerX, centerY, and radius.
It has a constructor accepting values for centerX, centerY, and radius.
It overrides calcArea to calculate and set the area of the circle.
Class Rectangle (Derived from BasicShape):

It has private variables width and length.
It has a parameterized constructor accepting values for width and length.
It overrides calcArea to calculate and set the area of the rectangle.
Main Class:

Create objects of Circle and Rectangle.
Demonstrate that each object properly calculates and reports its area.
Java Code:

Copy code
// Step 1: Abstract Base Class BasicShape
abstract class BasicShape {
    private double area;

    public double getArea() {
        return area;
    }

    // Abstract method
    public abstract void calcArea();
}

// Step 2: Circle Class
class Circle extends BasicShape {
    private long centerX, centerY, radius;

    // Constructor
    public Circle(long centerX, long centerY, long radius) {
        this.centerX = centerX;
        this.centerY = centerY;
        this.radius = radius;
        calcArea();
    }

    // Override calcArea
    @Override
    public void calcArea() {
        // Area of circle = Ï€ * radius * radius
        super.area = 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }
}

// Step 3: Rectangle Class
class Rectangle extends BasicShape {
    private double width, length;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    public Rectangle(double width, double length) {
        this.width = width;
        this.length = length;
        calcArea();
    }

    // Override calcArea
    @Override
    public void calcArea() {
        // Area of rectangle = length * width
        super.area = length * width;
    }
}

// Step 4: Main Class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 5: Demonstrate the classes
        Circle circle = new Circle(0, 0, 5);
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);

        // Output the areas
        System.out.println("Circle Area: " + circle.getArea());
        System.out.println("Rectangle Area: " + rectangle.getArea());
    }
}
Tricks for Extracting Key Information:
Identify Classes:

Look for terms like "class," "base class," or "derived class."
Note down the properties and behaviors mentioned for each class.
Constructor Information:

Identify the constructor and its parameters for each class.
Override Information:

Look for methods that need to be overridden in derived classes.
Usage Information:

Identify how the objects are supposed to be used or demonstrated.
By focusing on these key points, you can create a mental map of the problem and then translate it into code. Remember to keep it simple and gradually add complexity as needed.
